osm-pbf-leaflet
===============

Leaflet layer for parsing and displaying OpenStreetMap PBF (.osm.pbf)

NOTE: currently unmaintained and not tested with Leaflet versions >= 1.0.

An alternative is [osmtogeojson](https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson) that should also support OSM PBF format (through [tiny-osmpbf](https://github.com/tyrasd/tiny-osmpbf)).

Also note that loading raw OSM PBF data (.osm.pbf) is a special use case, usually you want Mapbox Vector Tiles (.mvt), see https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html#vector-tiles.
